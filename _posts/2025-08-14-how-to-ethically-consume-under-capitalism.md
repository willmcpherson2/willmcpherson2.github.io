> There is no ethical consumption under capitalism.

It's a common phrase, with no particular attribution.
Much like ["from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs), it's a slogan that gained traction in socialist circles.
What does it mean?
At a basic level, it means that our economic behaviour is [inevitably unethical](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29868458) due to the systematic injustice of our capitalist society.
While we can make better choices about how we earn and spend money, we are still operating in a corrupt system.

As long as we assume moral universalism, it is indeed true that our current economic arrangement is unfair.
Some people have no money, freedom or power, whereas others have an abundance.

First, we can disregard the [nirvana fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy) that everything is permitted.
The impossibility of perfectly ethical behaviour has no bearing on our efforts to improve material conditions.
