title: "Do not make AI"

We are currently in an arms race to create an artificial superintelligence.

If we make an AI that is more intelligent than us, or has more agency than us, it will almost certainly eliminate its competition.
There is absolutely no reason to assume that its goals will align with ours.

AI alignment is not even close to being solved.
We don't even know if it's solvable.

**Pause AI development immediately.**
