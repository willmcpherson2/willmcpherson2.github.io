Humanity has a long tradition of [bills of rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_rights).
A bill of rights is a legal *line in the sand*, affording universal rights and restricting violations of rights.

Over time, bills have expanded the class of people to which rights apply.
For example, while the [Magna Carta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta) is recognised as an important bill of rights, it applies only to [barons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_feudal_barony).

Bills have also progressively afforded more rights.
For example, the [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) places historically extreme restrictions on the ability of the government to pass laws which prohibit speech.

There have also been interesting developments in *positive rights*.
This ranges from basic things like the right to a lawyer, to more bold steps such as the right to food security.

In this post I'll try to predict what clauses we might see in bills of rights in the coming centuries.
